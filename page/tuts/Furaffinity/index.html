                <!-- <h1>This page is still WIP.. Might work on it or just be lazy..</h1> -->
                <h1>Do <b>YOU</b> want to troll FurAffinity, but you're such a lazy-puss? And do <b>YOU</b> want to know how? This is a tutorial for <b>LOSER(s)</b> like you that you can learn.</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="Part1">
                <h1>PART 1; Making a new account</h1>
                <p>So this is where you start off, new account to make. But how? You need to make a new name, and also an email. Email is pretty important for this step.</p>
                <p>If you don't want to use your personal email, you have to use a temporary mail. There's often chances that it won't work and spit out this error:</p>
                <ol id="ErrorBox" class="alignlefterror">
                    <li>The use of disposable e-mail addresses or e-mail forwarders has been disabled. Please use a real e-mail address. The e-mail provider in question is <i>[Provider Name]</i></li>
                </ol>
                <p>But if you manage to get the email disposed to you and create the account.. You're good!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Part2">
                <h1>PART 2; Setup before the trolling</h1>
                <p>Basically to setup your newly account. (If YOU want some attention and fame, while some death threats too..)</p>
                <p>Common way is put your social medias link and other stuff, maybe Discord? Eh sure. You can do that. BUT don't get it flooded it..</p>
                <p>Once you're done with all setups. Links, profile pics and such, such..</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Part3">
                <h1>PART 3; Time for some lulzy takes!</h1>
                <p>Now it's time for your users of your choice (or targets, whatever you call it). But how do you get a good one? Possibly a lolcow or nobody?</p>
                <p>My often method of getting the users at you at long period of time is the shouts box, which you can @ the user and they'll get back at you.</p>

                <h1>PART 4; The BAN-nish</h1>
                <p>The point that, your account will get banned. Maybe 20 minutes to few hours by your luck. So you can do it again and repeat the cycle, right?</p>
                <p><b>YES</b>, you can repeat it from part 1-3. But <b>NO</b>, you can't get quick fame for your trolling. (Like me idk)</p>

                <h1>END PART</h1>
                <p>Now this full tutorial (may be good or not by your taste), can help you how to be a lulzy troll in Furaffinity! But this be worked better on the later time.</p>
                <p>BUT, that's all for this page. Take your time and be a lulzy guy. Kay?</p>
